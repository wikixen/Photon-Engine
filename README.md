Photon Engine is a browser rendering engine that can parse HTML & CSS.

Capable of parsing the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <p id="placeholder">test</p>
</body>
</html>
```

It can parse HTML text, elements, attributes, & comments.

# Other

The name was inspired by [*Firefox*](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-firefox-quantum/) *[Quantum](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-firefox-quantum/)* because a quantum is a photon of light. I plan to expand on the engine and make a "toy" browser with a frontend built with *[Wails](https://wails.io/).*

Inspired by [Matt Brubeck's](https://github.com/mbrubeck) implementation in Rust.
